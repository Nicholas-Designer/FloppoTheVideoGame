# FloppoTheVideoGame

Hi and welcome to my project called: Floppo the Video Game. 
USP: You play as a red-eye tree frog exploring the rain forest, fighting off predations that cross paths with you, approaching epic boss battles, and amazing sights to see.


Code:

"Floppo Code Character.cpp/.h" - is the code that is running through the engine at this moment.
"Floppo Pawn.cpp/.h" - I've had problems with connecting the third-person character, and physics so I've moved over to the "Third Person base code" In the meantime, this has things that I have created within the project.
"AI Enemy.cpp/.h, AI States.cpp/.h, PathPoint.cpp/.h" - I did develop the start-ups for AI through coding I've just had difficulties linking my code to behavior trees, so I made the decision to do it based on the behavior tree mechanics.


Game Mode Tests:
Doing game Modes through code is quite a new aspect for me so I started to do it through a test level to get my way around the programming aspects within it, to then feel comfortable to add it into the project these are called:
"CodeGameMode.cpp/.h" and "CodeGameState.cpp/.h"
